# Non-Linear Dynamics
Projects for Non-Linear Dynamics class written in Python 3.

Makes use of the following external packages:
* graphics.py
* NLDGraphics --> Currently not publicly available will be working on a distribution for this.
* sympy
* numpy
* matplotlib
* Jupyter (ipython)

These can be installed via the updatePackages.sh file by first navigating to the directory the file is in via the command line then by typing:

```bash updatePackages.sh```

This will install or update all of the packages required for these scripts. Alternatively you can update all of your Python3 packages installed with pip by typing:

```bash updateAllPy3Pack.sh```

And the same goes for Python2 but with the command:

```bash updateAllPy2Pack.sh```
